### Description

My UFO Hunting game shows that you can create rotations with just VB, and using pretty simple code. In the game, the helicopter follows your cursor, always pointing in its direction, and using the searchlight, you try to spot the "UFO" (the black circle moving around on the screen), and click it to get points, all in 120 seconds. Just for fun, I included some cheats. To have a two-bladed helicopter, type "double" and to have slow spinning rotors, type "slow." Enjoy, and please vote!
